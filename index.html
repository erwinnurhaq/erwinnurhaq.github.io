            <p>Youkoso! Willkommen to my starting page. This is my first html coding after +- 7 years. Recently i studied Architecture at Indonesia University of Education (Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia), and Alhamdulillah luckyly i've graduated with some average assesments. I've been working at a small studio in Bandung for 4 years and now hitting my "end wall".. LOL</p>
            <p>About this page, i create this as i start to learn programming again. As for why, i decided it because i think i should zoom out my view a bit from my daily reality. Find out my real goals, find out what i really want to do, and of course without abandoning what i've been accomplish. i used to have fun learn about programming with my friends in highschool, Kuat Hadianto and M Ridhwan Ramdhani. But then we splited to different ways as we graduated.. Especially me</p>
            <p>Then what is My Personal Library..?</p>
            <p>I simply want to start to organize what i have. Digital things of course, such as my anime lists, what i plan to watch or have watched, or some architectural work lists, what i've worked or been working, etc. Though I'm not expected to people enjoy my page as usually people read blogs. Here it is..!</p>
